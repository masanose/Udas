;pro thm_crib_make_AE
;
; This is an example crib sheet that will calculate and plot "pseudo" geomagnetic
; indices (thmAE, thmAU, thmAL) as derived from THEMIS ground magnetometer data.
; In future, it is planned to include ground magnetometer data from other magnetometer
; networks. Note that currently the calculation of these "pseudo" indices does not
; subtract quiet day variation but simply the median.

; Example of generating THEMIS indices using all default values:
;
; - ground magnetometer data will be loaded into the active TDAS even if the
;   data already exist as tplot variables in the active TDAS. Hence, the
;   corresponding tplot variables will be overwritten
; - the time resolution is 60 sec (default value)
; - by default, the names of all stations used for calculation are
;   printed on the screen
